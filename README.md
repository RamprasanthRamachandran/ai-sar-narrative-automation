# AI SAR Narrative Automation

## Overview
This project addresses a common operational bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) teams:
junior analysts are trained to identify suspicious activity, but often receive limited training
on drafting clear, regulator-ready Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) narratives.

The result is inconsistent drafting quality, excessive senior analyst rework, and slower regulatory filings.
This tool assists analysts by generating structured, objective SAR narrative drafts.

---

## Why This Matters in AML
Regulators expect SARs to be:
- Clear
- Objective
- Well-structured
- Defensible

Poorly written narratives increase operational risk and review time.
This project focuses on the **final regulatory output**, not just alert investigation.

---

## Key Features
- Generates structured SAR narratives (Background, Activity, Rationale, Conclusion)
- Customisable narrative formats for different jurisdictions (e.g. UK SARs, FinCEN)
- Objective, regulator-focused language
- Designed to reduce senior analyst and MLRO rewrite time

---

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Understanding of SAR regulatory expectations
- Awareness of senior analyst review challenges
- Ability to translate AML workflows into practical tools
- Responsible use of AI with human oversight

---

## Tech Stack
- React
- Google Gemini API
- Prompt engineering for regulated outputs
